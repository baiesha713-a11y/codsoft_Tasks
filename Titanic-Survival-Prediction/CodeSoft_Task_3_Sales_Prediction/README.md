Sales Prediction Using Python

CodeSoft Internship – Machine Learning Task

📌 Project Description

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase based on advertising expenditure across different platforms. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical advertising data and predict sales accurately.

The goal of this project is to help businesses understand which advertising channels have the greatest impact on sales and support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objective

Analyze the relationship between advertising spend and sales

Build a machine learning model to predict sales

Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following features:

Column Name	Description
TV	Advertising budget spent on TV
Radio	Advertising budget spent on Radio
Newspaper	Advertising budget spent on Newspaper
Sales	Product sales (Target variable)
🛠 Tools & Technologies

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Loading

Data Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Building using Linear Regression

Model Evaluation

Insights and Conclusion

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Scatter plots were used to analyze relationships between advertising channels and sales

TV advertising shows a strong positive correlation with sales

Radio advertising has a moderate impact

Newspaper advertising has minimal influence on sales

🤖 Model Used

Linear Regression

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MSE (Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

The model achieved a strong R² score, indicating good predictive performance.

🔍 Key Insights

TV advertising contributes the most to sales growth

Radio advertising positively impacts sales but less than TV

Newspaper advertising has the least effect

Optimizing TV and Radio ad spend can significantly improve sales

✅ Conclusion

The Sales Prediction model successfully predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems to improve marketing strategies and maximize sales performance.
