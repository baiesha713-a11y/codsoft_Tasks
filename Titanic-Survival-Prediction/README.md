# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster
using machine learning classification techniques. It is a beginner-friendly
project that demonstrates the complete data analysis and modeling workflow.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (commonly sourced from Kaggle)
- Features include:
  - Passenger Class
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Family Size
  - Survival Status

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding and Scaling
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix

## Model Performance
The trained model is able to predict passenger survival with good accuracy,
showing strong performance in distinguishing between survived and non-survived passengers.

## Key Insights
- Gender and passenger class play a major role in survival chances
- Passengers in higher classes had higher survival rates
- Female passengers had a higher probability of survival

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of data preprocessing,
exploratory data analysis, and machine learning classification techniques.
It also highlights how data-driven models can be used to analyze real-world events.
